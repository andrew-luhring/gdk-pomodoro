Pomodoro
=====


This is a simple pomodoro app based on the sample Timer app.

When the app starts, the pomodoro immediately begins in a live card. When 
tapping the live card, a menu displays allowing a few actions:

- Pause: pause the pomodoro.  Shouldn't really be used, from what I
      understand about pomodoros
- Resume: resume a paused pomodoro
- Mulligan: resets to the beginning of the last pomodoro (from both
      within the work time and within the rest time)
- Stop: remove the pomodoro live card from the timeline

A 25 minute work block followed by a 5 minute rest block counts as a single
pomodoro, and when the next pomodoro starts, the pomos completed count is
incremented.

The voice trigger is:

"ok glass, start a pomodoro"
